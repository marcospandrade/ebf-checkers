Change Log v1.10
################

CheckersBoard
=============

General
-------
- Indexing has been changed so that it starts as 0 in the top left corner and increases moving to the right of the row. When it reaches the end of the row it continues on the row below. It only indexes possible locations for checkers pieces, so it ends at 32 at the bottom-right.
- Moves are generated, which store the indexes of the squares that a moving piece visits. Read the javaDocs and notes for "getAllMoves()".
	
Methods
-------
- NEW: "public List<List<Byte>> getAllMoves()" - returns a list of bytes that represent the indices of squares that the moved piece visits.
- NEW: IMPORTANT! "public void freeCache()" - frees the cached memory. InvertedBoards are stored for maximum efficiency, but this can leave a large chain of pointers, thus preventing explored children from being garbage collected. Call this method to free the cache, thus allowing the invertedBoard, moves list, and successors list to be garbage collected.
- NEW: public byte getSpacePos(int) - get the pieceType using the new indexing system.
- REMOVED: "public byte getSpaceDiagonalPos(int, int)" - Diagonal indexing no longer used.
- REMOVED: "public String printFancy()" - use "toString()" instead.



CheckersPlayer
==============

- Several new methods have been added. All of them must be implemented, but if AI's do not need to use them, they can leave the methods blank.

Methods
-------
- NEW: "public void notifyStartGame()" - AI's can use this to reinitialise variables at the start of every game. AI's can leave this method blank if not needed.
- NEW: "public void notifyEndGame(int)" - AI's can use this to analyse their performance at the end of the game. AI's can leave this method blank if not needed.
- NEW: "public void notifyRemainingTime(long)" - Notifies the AI of the remaining time left for their turn. Read method javaDoc for notes on use. AI's can leave this method blank, but it is recommended to use this, if AI is in fear of running out of time.
- NEW: "public String getName()" - Used to get the display name of the AI that will be used in the GUI. Please keep less than 30 chars.
- CHANGE: "public int takeTurn(CheckersBoard)" to "public int takeTurn(CheckersBoard, int)"



GameManager
===========

General
-------
- Some bugs fixed.
- Changes made to accommodate new CheckersBoard.


CheckersGUI
===========

General
-------
- NEW: All squares below pieces that can be moved are colored light green.
- NEW: When a piece is held, the starting and ending squares of possible moves are colored light green. Intermediate squares that are visited in a chain-jump are colored cyan.
- NEW: The starting and ending squares of the last move will be outlined in blue. If the last move was a chain-jump, the intermediate squares that are visited in the chain-jump, if any, are highlighted in magenta.
- NEW: Tile-Coloring / showing moves, can be disabled.
- NEW: Player Names are displayed.
- NEW: Auto-switching of players can be enabled/disabled in the Players Setup Dialog. Auto-switching automatically switches the player's sides every game.
- CHANGED: Player Names are used for the display instead of "Player 1" and "Player 2".
- CHANGED: General small changes.
